# “what should happen to a garden after the primary garden maker is no longer around?”

It depends. I don’t believe there’s a correct answer because every garden is different. 

I kind of agree with James Golden that “I really think of my garden as a garden that will exist until I die and then it will fade back into the woods” insofar as this is ultimately what will happen with all gardens. But it is a tad egocentric, as a  garden is something hopeful that can be passed down from generation to generation. Yes, they do need maintenance. But they can still be oh so useful for so many other people and creatures than just yourself.

In this respect, I feel that gardens are very similar to houses. [Stuart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) wrote a fantastic book called [How Buildings Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn), the idea being that buildings aren’t fixed and rigid but adapt and change with their human occupants (I’ve made a [YouTube playlist of the free BBC series](https://bit.ly/how-buildings-learn) if you’re interested).

So, for most gardens I think we should be asking “how can this garden be adapted for its new occupants?”, although there are gardens of historical and artistic merit, like Great Dixter and Gravetye Manor, which it makes sense to preserve as reference.
